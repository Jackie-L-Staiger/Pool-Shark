How To Perform Object Detection on a Raspberry Pi Using Tensorflow 
==================================================================

**Created 3/3/2020 (code borrowed from various sources)**

**Note:** due to the limited amount of memory on the raspberry pi, this tutorial requires the creation of a virtual machine (VM) instance on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) (this will be described in detail below) {: .note}

## Introduction
This file explains the general process of setting up TensorFlow for object detection on a 1 GB raspberry pi 4B, though earlier pi versions should work as well. An older version of TensorFlow is currently being used until the pycocotools bug with TensorFlow's model_main.py gets resolved. 

## Steps
### 1: Install Tensorflow, OpenCV, and All Their Necessary Dependencies
