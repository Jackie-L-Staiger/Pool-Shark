How To Perform Object Detection on a Raspberry Pi Using Tensorflow 
==================================================================

Created 3/3/2020

This procedure works was designed for the 1 GB raspberry pi 4B, though earlier versions should work as well

Note: due to the limited amount of memory on the raspberry pi, this tutorial requires the creation of a virtual machine (VM) instance on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) (this will be described in detail below)
